# About this project
This project (client & e2e) was generated using `npx create-nx-workspace@latest`.

The api was generated by first installing the nest plugin `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/nest` and then generated using `npx nx g @nrwl/nest:app api --frontendProject=ng-blog`

The domain lib was generated using `npx nx g @nrwl/workspace:lib domain`

# Running this project
To use the nx command, nx should be installed globally. Alternatively, you can run `npx nx serve *`.

By using the nx command instead of ng, we're able to take advantage of some additional capabilities that nx offers including an improved chaching mechanism.

## Client
The client can be started by running `nx serve ng-blog`

The client runs on port 4200 and can be accessed locally at localhost:4200

## API
The api can be started by running `nx serve api`

The database can be hydrated via the api by accessing the root controller at `localhost:3333/api`

When the api runs in production mode `/environments/environment.ts` is replaced with `/environments/environment.prod.ts`. The api can be started in production mode by running `nx serve api --configuration production`

## E2E
The e2e suite can be executed by running `nx e2e ng-blog-e2e:e2e --watch`

This command will start the client but the api must be started separately.
